This bounty is for a fix for the underlying problem which those tests identify.\n \n \n  Bounty acceptance criteria:\n \n \n  \n   Bounty claimant must submit one or more pull requests to\n   \n    trufflesuite/ganache-core\n   \n   and/or its underlying dependencies (likely\n   \n    ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm\n   \n   and/or\n   \n    ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree\n   \n   ), and meet the necessary requirements defined by the projects' contributing guidelines for these PRs to be accepted by the project maintainers.\n  \n  \n   Submissions must make the tests submitted in\n   \n    trufflesuite/ganache-core#41\n   \n   pass.\n  \n  \n   The tests submitted in\n   \n    trufflesuite/ganache-core#41\n   \n   may be modified if necessary to demonstrate the fix, so long as the modified tests continue to demonstrate the underlying problem with the fixes reverted.\n  \n  \n   Submitters should take care to avoid causing significant performance degradation to\n   \n    ganache-core\n   \n   or any other impacted projects.\n  \n \n \n  \n   Important note\n  \n  : This bounty will not be paid out until all required PRs are accepted and merged.\n \n \n  Tips:\n \n \n  \n   When making changes to an underlying dependency of\n   \n    ganache-core\n   \n   you can use\n   \n    npm link\n   \n   to symlink your local copy of the dependency into the\n   \n    node_modules\n   \n   directory of the\n   \n    ganache-core\n   \n   project.\n  \n  \n   When editing ethereumjs projects, be sure to follow their style guidelines, using the\n   \n    standard\n   \n   tool to verify that you have done so."
